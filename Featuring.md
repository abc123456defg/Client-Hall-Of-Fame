## Chazed AKA Phase
Originally exposed for pasting Memeware into his client Nekoware (The client base itself was memeware...). 
The client was leaked by me and some friends, later his face and ip were leaked. 
He came back under a new alias known as Chazed. He created "Zyth" client, a pasted client using wavelength base.
After the source for that client was leaked by Hello_SW he created Haptic. Haptic used Vestige as a base and was also leaked by Hello_SW...

Average paster, claims pasting LB isnt pasting because its open source. Groomed a femboy (coinful) 💀

## LCA_MODZ
Pasted client, intent base + 1000 other sources he frankensteined together to create his client. To be fair his client is free and does not dispute it being skidded. Notable things pasted from
